                  Speaking of the Scientific and Technical Achievement awards, 
                  2015’s winner of the coveted Gordon E. Sawyer Award for 
                  “technological contributions that have brought credit to the 
                  industry” was David W. Gray. You may not have heard of him, 
                  but there’s no doubt you’ve probably heard his work at some 
                  point. His sound technology has been used on films like Die 
                  Hard, Rambo and RoboCop. Want to know what the long-time 
                  Dolby® Laboratories executive did before making the silver 
                  screen boom? He was on the road building custom stereos and 
                  amps for ‘70s rock icons like Frank Zappa and Lou Reed.
